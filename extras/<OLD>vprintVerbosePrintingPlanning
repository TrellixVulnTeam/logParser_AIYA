This is documentation from a different version of the program- on 06/04/19, i did 4 hrs of work many of which related to this document and the code that went with it.
I then tried a fuzzing program to make sure it wasnt broken, using the command `fuzzer.py > logParser.py`.
That... was not the right command. I had to redo the last four hours of work.

(high p, high v) will almost certianly be caught by one of the three <<needs work>>
(high p, low v) if p is larger than v it's printed <<good>
(low p, high v) will likely be higher than 0 <<good>
(low p, low v) it's not important and we dont care so it wont be printed <<good>>

v: [1, ∞) #cant get in with less than 1 v
p: (-∞, ∞)

v = 2, p = 5: (important)
	1. yes
	2. no
	3. no

v = 2, p = 1 (sorta matters)
	1. no
	2. no
	3. yes

v = 2, p = 2 (matters and we wanna hear it)
	1. no
	2. no
	3. yes

v = 1, p = 2 (matters)
	1. yes
	2. no
	3. no

v = 2, p = -2 (irrelevant but we wanna hear)
	1. no
	2. no
	3. yes, 2 - (-2) = 4

v = 1, p = 1 (sorta wanna haer and it sorta matters)
	1. no
	2. no
	3. yes

v = 2, p = 0 (wanna hear but its not important)
	1. no
	2. no
	3. yes

v = 1, p = -100000 (sorta wanna hear and nobody cares)
	1. no
	2. no
	3. no


all in all it's probably fine

verbose level = minimum alert level
	something - vlevel =
