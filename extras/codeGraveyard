#The code graveyard is a fun thing I do when coding.
#Inevitably, I'm gonna write some dumb code that ultimately gets replaced by better code which does the job better (or right in the first place).
#When that happens, I send the old code here.
#For the most part it's just kinda neat to look back on, but occasionally I realize another purpose for prevously exiled code and come back to my graveyard files to retrieve it.
