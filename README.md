# logParser
im not very good at python pls no bully
Developed on python 3.6.7, using Geany
Uses psutil, you'll have to install it using pip3 (or just use the -f flag, it gets rid of some safety measures but you wont need psutil then)

switches:

-f removes some safety precautions and "forces" it to read the file
-w forces windows style commands even if your OS isnt windows
-l forces linux style commands even if your OS isnt linux
-x disables the spinny load thing, but why would you want to do that?
	i put literally minutes into coding that and you're just gonna break my heart like that? </3
